Some day in late july I decided to add code to my open source projects every day. I wanted to put pressure on myself to get things done. After all, if you code for one year, something valueable has to be the result, right?

As you can the in the diagram above it started out really well. It was fun and I made good progress. My time tracking tool began to take shape. 

But at some points, the tasks I liked where nearly finished. The less it was about design and frontend code, the more I just coded because I had to get one of those green squares. Backend-, server- and business-stuff can be fun too, but I'm simply not fluent in it. I don't get into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" title="Flow State">flow state</a> with it.

Some weeks ago, when I finally broke the code-every-day-rule, my mind shifted to a new project. That's basically why I never finish my projects. I don't have a real solution for this right now. At least, I'm aware of it while coding for slindo. Maybe, this blog will help to overcome this problem.
