Once ready, <a href="https://slindo.com/">slindo</a> will serve as a hub for all my small and big projects.

First, I will create some free productivity tools for sole users. The focus will be on ease of use.

Afterwards, I'll go on with simplistic productivity tools for small teams. I will take a look if I can monetize them at some point. The first project will be the timetracker, which I already mentioned in my <a href="/coding-every-day/">last post</a>.

In the far future, it might be possible to combine these tools in one bigger product.
